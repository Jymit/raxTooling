Help me fuel the addiction ;)



Place of daily tooling:

*base2ascii.sh*
- First iteration was to make the code short and sweet like a Cannoli
- Will move to a one liner, such as `./base2ascii.sh someBase64HEre`
- Also for the other way around Ascii to Base64, Hex, etc.

*hex2ascii.sh*
- As per above

*testssl.sh*
- From [here](https://testssl.sh/bleichenbacher/) for testing the ROBOT (Return of Bleichenbacher's Oracle Threat) Vuln.
- `./testssl.sh --robot 192.168.121.7`

*simpleHTTPServer.sh*
- The python kind
- `./simpleHTTPServer.sh 9998`
